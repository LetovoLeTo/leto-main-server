This is the main server for LeTo. It handles everything, basically - all the services and resources.
I just thought it would be convenient if all of this could be run using just one repository.

## Running
You'll have to have Git and NodeJS installed.\
First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/LetovoLeTo/leto-main-server.git
cd leto-main-server
npm i
```
Now you can run the server:
```sh
npm start
```
